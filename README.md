Testing the low power timer with pro mini and an SHT31-D

I am using a 3.3V generic pro mini, a real-time clock, an SD card reader, and a low power timer breakout (TPL5110) from adafruit.  The main purpuse is to make sure I can get the low power breakout working on the mini-pro because we are having trouble getting it to work with an Adafruit Feather.
