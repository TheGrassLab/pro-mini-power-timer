Testing the low power timer with pro mini and an SHT31-D

I am using a 3.3V pro-mini clone, a real-time clock (DS3231), an SD card reader, and a low power timer breakout (TPL5110) from Adafruit.  The main purpuse is to make sure I can get the low power breakout working on the pro-mini because we are having trouble getting it to work with an Adafruit Feather.
